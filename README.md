# CryptoCycle

**Recycle the Dust. Reclaim the Value.**

CryptoCycle is a decentralized protocol that collects low-value or idle crypto tokens (a.k.a. "dust"), aggregates them, reinvests them into promising DeFi opportunities, and redistributes the profits proportionally back to the original contributors.

---

## 🌍 Why CryptoCycle?

Many users hold small amounts of worthless or forgotten tokens that cannot be traded or used. CoinCycle turns this passive "dust" into active potential by:

- Pooling low-value tokens from multiple users
- Converting them into stable or yield-bearing assets
- Reinvesting using proven DeFi strategies
- Distributing rewards proportionally
- Taking a small protocol fee to sustain development

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Token Deposit**  
   Users send unwanted tokens to the CoinCycle smart contract.

2. **Conversion & Pooling**  
   The contract aggregates these tokens and swaps them into stablecoins.

3. **Yield Strategy**  
   The stablecoins are reinvested into DeFi protocols like Aave, Yearn, or Compound.

4. **Profit Distribution**  
   After a yield cycle, profits are redistributed to original contributors based on input value.

5. **Protocol Fee**  
   A small percentage of profits is retained for protocol development.

## 🔐 Key Components

- `Vault.sol` – Core contract for deposits, conversion, and distribution
- `SwapHelper.sol` – Token swapping via DEX aggregators (Uniswap, 1inch)
- `StrategyManager.sol` – Handles integration with yield protocols
- `Frontend (WIP)` – Web3 dApp for interaction and stats
